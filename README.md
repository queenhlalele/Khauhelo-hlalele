#hy 🤝welcome to my life where you'll embark on a journey of knowing me even more 

#sports wise🏐🎖 

i am a very passionate human being with so much interst in sports and also exploring the real life . i played netball from a very young age , i found comfort in it & whenever i was exposed to the court i made the best out of it.netball was my second nature it was my home away from my real home .

#education wise📝

i went to voorwaarts primary school & later on i went to zenith high school where i completed my high school education . i take this year as a gap year because again next year I'll be applying for tertiary level the reaso behind sitting at home is because of financial setbacks but 2026 here i come you literally have nothing on me .

#personality & character wise🛐

i am one dedicated individual , whenever i set my mind to something i give it my best shot .I'll like to leave my toxic traits behind and grow up to be the best version of myself
